			<p> NEW YORK  (AP)   Baseball Commissioner  Bud Selig says the sport will wait until after the season to study  whether the rule preventing pitchers from using pine tar should be  changed.</p>
          <p>New York Yankees pitcher Michael  Pineda was suspended for 10 games Thursday, a day after umpires found  pine tar on his neck during a game against Boston. Pineda said he was  trying to get a better grip on balls on a cool night, and pitchers say  they suspect pine tar use may be routine - although usually discreet.</p>
            <p>Baseball rules prohibit pitchers from using foreign substances.</p>

         <p>There was no immediate announcement regarding whether or not Harper had suffered an injury.</p>
