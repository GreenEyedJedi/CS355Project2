CS355Project2
=============

The .AppleDouble folders are not part of Project 2. When I log in to my cwolf right from my Macintosh desktop, it adds
the .AppleDouble folder and duplicates files within the directory. Please disregard any content within the .AppleDouble
directories. 

The public folder contains code that is used to create a visual table of my database using codebase. Please be sure
to use codebase in order for the tables to work.

Also within the public folder is the necessary images and .css file for the website.

There is a RelationalSchema folder that contains a .jpg of the project's relational schema. There is also a link
on the website that takes to directly to it.

Thank you for taking the time to review my project and I hope you have a great summer!
